                <p>During the summer Ten Noey resolutely goes outside, on the street, on squares and in parks. We
                    save
                    neither effort nor time (but are<br>saving on our money) to set up a summer operation
                    where on the one hand the wealth of Sint-Joost-ten-Node comes to light<br>(local artists get
                    a stage, nice unknown<br>places are opened up, neighbors are invited on the street<br>to
                    of
                    to get in touch with each other.
                    <br><br>The summer project used to be called: <br>Building the Summer of Sint-Joost, where we have
                    children
                    and let adults get to work with all possible (recycled)<br>building materials. Like this
                    they formed
                    a boring park into a pleasant<br>place to hangout, or did they build huts for the children
                    could<br>climb up
                    or could hide in.
                    Since the corona summer<br>of 2020, we keep Camping Josée open during the summer.<br>Josée is a
                    fictitious
                    figure who invites everyone who does not go on holiday<br>to her at the campsite for a
                    beer,<br>some music, playing fun and of course: for nice chats on the terrace. </p>
